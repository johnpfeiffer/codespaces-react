# Welcome to Our Blog

Welcome to our brand new blog! This platform is built using **React** and features a *custom markdown parser* that we built from scratch.

## Features

Our blog supports all the essential markdown features:

* **Bold text** and *italic text*
* Headers of different levels
* Links like [React](https://reactjs.org "React Official Site")
* Blockquotes for emphasis
* Lists (both ordered and unordered)

> This is a blockquote. It's perfect for highlighting important information or quotes from other sources.

## What's Coming Next

1. More blog posts about web development
2. Tutorials and guides
3. Code examples and best practices
4. Tips and tricks for React developers

We're excited to share our knowledge and experiences with you. Stay tuned for more content!

### Technical Details

This blog uses a minimal markdown parser that handles:

- Headers (h1-h6)
- Paragraphs and line breaks  
- **Bold** and *italic* text
- [Links](https://example.com) with optional titles
- Blockquotes
- Both ordered and unordered lists
- Horizontal rules

Feel free to explore the blog and check back regularly for new posts!
